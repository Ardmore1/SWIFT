This is a tool I created that brings together information from Active directory and MS config manager and allows a Level-1 IT Tech to perform management actions on users and or computers using that info and the tools I created in this program
'Program written by Rick ardmore for the purpose of helping
'The IT tech support and engineers can quickly find employees
'IP address, last PC they logged into, remote controll the PC,
'Get database information out of ConfigMGR about the PC,
'reset Ad passwords, connect to PC functions such as manage this PC,
'Get logon history, unlock accounts and much much more
'This tool set allows level1 techs to make use of the advanced features in
'MS ConfigMGR and Active directory without having to know how to use either.

-After selecting a user, the tech can click last logged in PC and receives this window in which the form is filled in with a lot of very useful information about the PC the remote person is using.
It also provides many useful tools such remote control the PC, jump to their C drive, manage their computer.
Example Usage: The level-1 tech can type in the users name, click last logged on PC, and then click remote control. -> in less than 3 seconds this tech is now on the screen with the employee helping them. This is compared to the traditional way in which the tech would have to spend 30 minutes walking the employee though figuring out their IP address, or opening some program to grant remote control to their PC.
